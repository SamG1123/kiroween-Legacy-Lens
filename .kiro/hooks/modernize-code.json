Identify legacy patterns like callbacks → promises → async/await, var → let/const, function → arrow functions, old APIs → modern equivalents, and ES5 → ES6+ features. Check for outdated packages, deprecated APIs, and security vulnerabilities. Suggest improvements with modern syntax, better patterns, performance optimizations, and type safety. Show before/after examples and estimate effort and impact for each suggestion."
