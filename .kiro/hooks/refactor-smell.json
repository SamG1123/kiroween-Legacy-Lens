Identify: long functions (>50 lines), high complexity (>10), duplicate code, deep nesting (>4 levels), magic numbers/strings, and poor naming. For each smell found, explain the issue, show the problematic code, suggest a refactoring, and show the improved code. Prioritize by impact (high/medium/low) and ask if I want to apply any refactorings."
