Check for common vulnerabilities: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication/authorization issues, sensitive data exposure, insecure dependencies, hardcoded secrets, unsafe deserialization, and path traversal. For each issue found, provide severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), location in code, explanation of the risk, recommended fix, and example of secure code. Suggest security best practices and check if dependencies have known vulnerabilities."
